We have LOVED Popcap's casual games growing up, we would play for hours on end.
One day, a friend of ours suggested: "Why not make open-source remakes of those Popcap games?"
We have now started a small project of remaking our childhood games.

Our roadmap:
Plants-Vs-Zombies
Insaniquarium
Peggle
(More to come!)
